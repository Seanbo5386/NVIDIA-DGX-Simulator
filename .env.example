# Environment Variables for DC-Sim
# Copy this file to .env and configure as needed
# This is a client-side only application - all variables are compile-time constants

# Build and runtime environment
# Automatically set by Vite based on build command (dev/build)
# NODE_ENV=development

# Vite-specific variables (must have VITE_ prefix to be exposed to client)
# These are embedded into the client bundle at build time

# Future use - API endpoint if backend is added
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Feature flags (future use)
# VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
# VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG=true

# Logging configuration (future use)
# VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Notes:
# - Only VITE_* prefixed variables are exposed to the client code
# - All other variables are server-side only (Node.js, build scripts)
# - Never commit .env files to version control
# - This example shows commented-out variables for documentation purposes
